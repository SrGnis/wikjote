    A custom formatter class that enhances readability by adding indentation based on the call stack depth.

    This subclass of `logging.Formatter` provides functionality to indent log records, 
    making it easier to trace their origin within nested function calls or method invocations. 
    The indentation is relative to a baseline, defined as the current position in the 
    call stack when an instance of this formatter is initialized.
